# MySceneFinalProject
NOTE: because the project is bigger than discords normal upload size I had to use a their large file systems. If you want to download the zips you have to clone
it. Downloading straight from the browser will result in an invalid file.


This project helped improve many design skills of mine.  A methodical approach to design as well as a lot of research is key to creating a good solution. The design
process that I followed was one of Research, Brainstorm, impliment, test, Repeat. I believe this general methodology to go alongside with agile development 
meaning there will be plenty of use for my design tactics in future work. My approach to developing code has remained largly the same just with more effort needed 
in certain areas as things get tougher. Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowlege and skills that can be applied in any area of computer science.
While I learned a lot about computational graphics the main success in coding comes from the methodology and the research put in.
